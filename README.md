# mqtt-to-i2c-led

This project is intended to be used as an universal driver for different kind of lights and sensors around the Raspberry Pi.
The initial use case is controlling some led strips and pir sensors.

To realize the pwm signal generation, this project
makes use of an **Adafruit PCA9685** compatible servo driver board which is connected to the Pi via IÂ²C bus.

## Requirements

- Raspberry Pi
- Adafruit PCA9685
- some kind of amplifier circuit (e. g. MOSFET or other LED driver)

## Installation

This project is written in [Python](https://www.python.org/). You should setup Python3 on your system first.

### Setup virtual environment

To get a clean environment for the project to run, we make use of the virtual environments bundled with Python. You can create a new environment by opening a shell in the folder containing this project and enter:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

### Install dependencies

The required dependencies for this project are named in the `requirement.txt` file. To install them via PIP, enter the virtual environment and execute:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

The program is designed to be configured via an .ini file with the following structure. 

The general section specifies the parameters to connect to your mqtt broker.
After that you can create multiple sections, each starting with `device:` in the section name, followed by an arbitrary name.
Each device section consists of the option `type`, which specifies if the device is a `color-light`, `on-off` device or a `pir`.

| `type`         | Description                                                                                     | Required options                                                                                                                                                                 | Topics                                                               |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| color-light    | Represents a color light (e.g. a LED color strip), using three pwm channel (one foreach color). | - pins: defines the pwm channels <br />- id: name part of the mqtt topic <br />- basetopic: prefix part of the mqtt topic <br />- value_range: value for maximum brightness (and color)      | - *{basetopic}*/*{id}*/power <br />- *{basetopic}*/*{id}*/color <br />- *{basetopic}*/*{id}*/brightness      |
| dimmable-light | Represents a dimmable light (e.g. a LED strip), using one pwm channel.                          | - pin: defines the pwm channel <br />- id: name part of the mqtt topic <br />- basetopic: prefix part of the mqtt topic <br />- value_range: value for maximum brightness        | - *{basetopic}*/*{id}*/power <br />- *{basetopic}*/*{id}*/brightness |
| on-off         | Represents a simple on/off switch, using one pwm channel.                                       | - pin: defines the pwm channel <br />- id: name part of the mqtt topic <br />- basetopic: prefix part of the mqtt topic                                                          | - *{basetopic}*/*{id}*/power                                         |
| pir            | Represents a pir sensor, sending its state via mqtt message when it gets triggered.             | - gpio: defines the gpio pin connected to the sensor <br />- id: name part of the mqtt topic <br />- basetopic: prefix part of the mqtt topic                                    | - *{basetopic}*/*{id}*/power                                         |


__Example config__

```ini
[general]
mqtt_host: broker.youdomain.tld
mqtt_port: 1883
mqtt_protocol: tcp

[device:lamp1]
type: color-light

## Running

To execute the project, you have two choices.

### Manual mode

To run the project manually, you can execute the following:

```bash
venv/bin/python main.py
```

### Service mode

To let the system automatically manage the program run, you can use the [attached systemd service template](mqtt-to-i2c-led.example.service). After setting the path to this program and copying the `.service` file to `/etc/systemd/system/mqtt-to-i2c-led.service` you can start the service as follows:

```bash
systemctl start mqtt-to-i2c-led
```

To autostart the service on each system boot, enable it:

```bash
systemctl enable mqtt-to-i2c-led
```
